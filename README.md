Drupal_SwaggerUI
================

A Drupal 7 custom module that embeds Swagger UI

1) update the file /js/call_swagger line #12 to point to your own swagger source
2) Zip the whole directory
3) Install the zip module into Drupal 7 as normal
4) Enable the module Swagger UI Page in the group POINT.IO MODULES
5) Goto http://yoursite/api/ActiveDocs to view swagger output

Libraries from the project https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui are embedded here and may need updating periodically.

Enjoy!
